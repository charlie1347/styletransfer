## Style transfer

A modification of [Logan Engstrom's fast style transfer CNN](https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer) - adding a style from famous paintings to an image using a CNN in Tensorflow.

I've encased the CNN in an Azure web app and made an interface via either IPython Notebook, or via a dedicated website - [http://styletransfer.azurewebsites.net/](http://styletransfer.azurewebsites.net/).

The website only allows one style transfer (Picasso's La Muse) for now. See the ipynb for the full range.

Azure web app created using [Ilia's tutorial](https://github.com/ilkarman/Azure-WebApp-w-CNTK).
